Changes to stylecop
-SA 1200: Using directives included outside of namespace as seen in default classes and mentioned in class
-SA 1302: Interfaces don't have any need to start with an I. Professor does not follow this and status
of a class as an interface should be known regardless
-SA 1600 and SA1401 have been kept on, despite warnings as assignment instructions specify actions
breaking these rules at the top of the Cell.cs class
